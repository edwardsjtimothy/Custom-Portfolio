                        <p class="card-text">Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                        <p> Continuing to share this site in its current form was a subject of quite a bit of internal debate on my part.
                            Both the projects showcased and the portfolio itself were created several years ago when I was still working through the Fullstack certificate program I attended at Vanderbilt or shortly after graduating. 
                            Since then, I have been privileged to be a part of a truly outstanding team of engineers at UBS and my technical and architectural proficiency has grown a great deal. Looking at them now, most of the projects 
                            I have showcased are showing their age; when I review the code, I can see any number of ways I would do things differently were I to go back and tackle them again. I thought about doing just that.
                            But I've decided there is still value to be had here as a means to demonstrate my advancement as a developer and engineer. So to that end, rather than spend time revisiting old work, I have put my old projects
                            in their own section marked, "Legacy", and I will add new work as time allows. If you have any questions about what I would improve, just ask! Thank you!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tim, 2022</p>
